# minimal-frontend

An simple, minimal HTML5/CSS3/jQuery skeleton with some features and ideas from [HTML5Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), HTML5Reset, Modernizr and the LESS 4 Framework.

Useful to develop static pages or small websites focusing on the UI before going into backend development.

## Filesystem Structure

### header.php
- Conditional IE comments to avoid loading different external stylesheets.
- Minimal custom modernizr.js in the head section for HTML5 elements in older browsers.
- Simple title variable specified in the index.php file.
