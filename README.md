Minifront
=========

A simple, server agnostic, minimal HTML5/CSS3/jQuery skeleton with some features and ideas from [HTML5Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), [HTML5Reset](http://html5reset.org/), [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) and the [LESS 4 Framework](http://lessframework.com/).

Useful to develop static pages or small websites focusing on the UI before going into back-end development.

## Flow.

Just start coding the HTML5 in index.html. Then add some CSS3 awesomeness to css/style.scss, throw some jQuery plugins in js/plugins.js, fight with your semicolons in js/start.js and you'll be ready to go writing some Ruby.

## Filesystem Structure.

### index.html
