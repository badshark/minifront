Minifront
=========

A simple, server agnostic, minimal HTML5/CSS3 skeleton with some features and ideas from [HTML5Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), [HTML5Reset](http://html5reset.org/) and the [LESS 4 Framework](http://lessframework.com/).

Useful to develop static pages or small websites focusing on the UI before going into back-end development.

## Flow.

Just start coding the HTML5 in index.html and add some CSS to css/style.scss, throw some JS libraries in js/lib.js, fight with your semicolons in js/start.js and you'll be ready to go writing some Ruby.  

## Filesystem Structure.

### index.html
- Minimal HTML5 shiv for IE8 or less.
- Page template. You can just duplicate and rename it to add a new page.
- Javascript resources loaded in the footer to speed up page loading.

### css/style.css
- Vertical grid with basehold.it as background.
- General reset rules.
- Typography section (Modify according to your needs)
- Colors section (Add CSS colors here)
- Objects section (Write global OOCSS classes here)

### js/lib.js
- Place all your JS libraries here.

### js/start.js
- Write your own JavaScript here.

### img/
- Place your images here.

### fonts/
- Place your web fonts here.
